Umbraco 4 Localization Contribution
======================

This project contains the xml files used for localizing the Umbraco backoffice.

If you want to help out in the efforts of translating the backoffice of Umbraco 4 to your local language then fork this repository and start translating.

The Default.xml file contains the default localization file used to display the backoffice in English. You can use this file when starting a new translation by creating a copy and naming it according to the [ISO-639-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes "List of ISO 639-1 codes") definition of the language you are going to make the translation for.

Once you are done send us a pull request. We will merge your pull request once the translation has been approved by at least one other person who understands the language of your translation ;)
Please note that you don't *have* to submit a complete translation. We will accept partial translations and merge them untill we have a complete translation of a given language. Complete translations will ultimately be added to the Core.
Also, remember to update your fork regularly as we receive a lot of partials translations.

All contributors will be awarded the "Core Contributor"-badge on their [our.umbraco.org](http://our.umbraco.org/wiki/about/core-contributor "Umbraco Community Forum") profile.
